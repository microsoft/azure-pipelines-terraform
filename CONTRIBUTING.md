# Contributing

If you want to get started developing this task, then there are a few setup steps to follow.

## Initial Setup

1. Clone the repo.
1. Navigate to the V5 task with `cd Tasks/TerraformTask/TerraformTaskV5`.
1. Run `npm install -include=dev`.

## Testing

1. Navigate to the V5 task with `cd Tasks/TerraformTask/TerraformTaskV5`.
1. Run `npm test`.

## Deploying

1. Navigate to the root folder of the repo.
1. If you haven't already, setup a https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage account and publisher following [these](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/extend/publish/overview?toc=%2Fazure%2Fdevops%2Fmarketplace-extensibility%2Ftoc.json&view=azure-devops#create-a-publisher) steps.
1. Run `npm install -include=dev`.
1. Create a file called `self.json` inside the `configs folder`. The file contents should look like the following, but replace the `publisher` field with the publisher you setup earlier.
```json
{
    "id": "custom-terraform-tasks",
    "name": "Terraform (Dev - Individual)",
    "public": false,
    "publisher": "<replace-me-with-your-publisher>",
    "version": "0.1.0"
}
```
5. Replace the `version` with the version prior to the one you are want to publish.
5. Run `npm run build:release`.
1. Run `npm run package:self`.
1. This will generate a `.vsix` file prefixed with your published name.
1. Navigate to your publisher portal: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage/publishers
1. Choose your publisher and select  `New extension` and choose `Azure DevOps`.
1. You'll be prompted to drag and drop your `.vsix` file, do that and wait for it to be verified. Ensure you choose that your extension will be Private.
1. Click on the three dots `...` next to the extension name and choose `Share/Unshare`.
1. Click `+ Organization` and enter the name of your Azure DevOps org.
1. Now navigate to your Azure DevOps org and install the extension as you would any other.
1. You are now ready to use the extension and test it.
